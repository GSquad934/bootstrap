# Bootstrap
This is a script that can be used to automate the setup of a workstation or a personal computer.

# Compatibility
This works on macOS and various flavors of Linux (mainly Debian based, Red Hat based and Arch based).

# Usage
In order to execute this script, download this repository and execute the .bootstrap.sh script.
Execute the following commands for easy setup:

```
git clone https://github.com/GSquad934/bootstrap.git
bootstrap/bootstrap.sh
```

# TODO
There are still quite a few enhancements to be done. Here is a list of things required:

- Fully automate the system preferences on macOS (some still require the GUI)
- Pimp the output so it would be more appealing to the eye
- Output the entire action logs to a file
