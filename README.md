# Bootstrap
This is a script that can be used to automate the setup of a workstation or a personal computer.

# Compatibility
This works on macOS and various flavors of Linux (mainly Debian based, Red Hat based and Arch based).

# Usage
In order to execute this script, execute the following command:

```
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GSquad934/bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

# TODO
There are still quite a few enhancements to be done. Here is a list of things required:

- Fully automate the system preferences on macOS (some still require the GUI)
- Include additional package lists for specific contexts (work, studio, home, etc...) with a custom menu
- Pimp the output so it would be more appealing to the eye
- Output the entire action logs to a file
